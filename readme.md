version 0.0.12:
added quadratics

version 0.0.1:
added two problems of geometric sequences from khanacademy.
very simple and naive checking of solutions
no other functions

to-do:
* calculator
* user profiles
  * allow user to see score. select from a range of topics to select a pool of questions from
* scoring, session and overall
* tutorials
* segregation of math by subject, topic
* graphical user interface
* graphs of some problems when applicable
* allow user to set up problems easier, such as, extending Problem class to many subtypes and allow each one to be set up with their coefficients
    examples: finite geometric series can be set up with a1, and r, as coefficients. The program fills in the rest, and displays according to a flag
    whether the problem is to be displayed explicitly, recursively, or in the form of "a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an".
    so I would need a1, r, and n. for each problem.
    also, for line equations, i would need a, b, and c, and to tell the program whether to display in point-slope form or y =mx+b form.

problems to add
k = 0 to 99 sum 2(3)^k

topics
* algebra 2
  * divide polynomials with remainders
